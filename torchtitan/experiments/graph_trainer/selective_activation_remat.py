    For each ``must_recompute`` forward node consumed by a backward node, a

    whose consumers were all backward become dead and are erased; originals
    with remaining forward consumers stay.

    The graph is mutated in place: original node identities and names are
    preserved, only the duplicates carry a ``_recomputed`` suffix. No

    ``node.meta["autograd_backward"] == True``, set by both Dynamo and
    non-strict ``make_fx`` tracing when tracing ``torch.autograd.grad``.

        A recompute dup consuming an offloaded forward node must read from
        the reload chain on GPU, not from F's freed storage. The offload
        pass places the reload chain before F's *first existing* backward
        consumer, but a recompute dup is a NEW consumer that the offload
        pass didn't see. The dup may land earlier in graph order than F's
        first existing backward consumer; when it does, the chain must be
        hoisted to keep ``dup -> reload_chain`` topologically valid.

        Concrete example where this fires (layer K's offloaded residual,
        consumed in forward by layer K+1 via a must_recompute op):

            # forward (layer K):
            F = add(...)                           # offloaded
            offload_op = ao.offload(F); ...        # → CPU, frees F's GPU mem
            # forward (layer K+1):
            N = layer_norm(F)                      # must_recompute, needs F

            # ──────── backward begins ────────
            # backward of layer K+1 (runs FIRST in reverse-order bwd):
            grad_layer_K1_input = ...              # transitively wants N
            #   ↑ remat inserts N_recomputed here  ← bwd_target for N
            #     N_recomputed's arg F is redirected to wait_tensor

            # backward of layer K (runs LATER in bwd):
            reload_default = ao.reload(...)        # ← chain originally here:
            wait_tensor    = ao.wait_tensor(...)   #   offload pass placed it
            grad_F = layer_K_bwd(wait_tensor, ...) #   before *this* consumer

        Because backward is reverse, layer K+1's backward is *earlier* in
        graph order than layer K's backward — so N_recomputed sits ahead
        of the reload chain. Without hoisting, N_recomputed would
        reference a wait_tensor that hasn't been defined yet → topology
        violation. We move the chain in front of ``target`` (here: the
        first bwd_node of layer K+1's backward).

        ``moved_offload`` keeps moves idempotent and ensures the chain
        ends up before the earliest target across repeated calls.
